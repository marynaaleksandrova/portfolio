            p Nowadays when most of business interactions are happening online&mdash;finding clients, communication, negotiation, invoicing, payments&mdash;it becomes almost obsolete for small-/ medium-sized studios to have a physical brand identity including branded envelopes, file folders, etc. It is important to create a continuous brand representation across social media, website, blog and cover basic business needs, such as invoicing.
